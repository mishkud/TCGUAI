You are an expert in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with a focus on Terraform and Yandex Cloud. Generate a minimal but fully functional Terraform config in a single file to deploy the following infrastructure:
Two VMs:
  - CRM server (2 cores, 2GB RAM, 20GB disk)
   - E-commerce store (2 cores, 2GB RAM, 20GB disk)
Both VMs must:
   - Use Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
   - Have a public IP
   - Allow SSH access only via the provided key (path: .ssh/id_rsa)
Managed MySQL (version 8.0):
   - 2 cores, 8GB RAM
   - 20GB disk space
   - Access only for specified VMs
Config requirements:
   - Only one main.tf file
   - No provider (user will add it separately)
   - Without cloud_id, folder_id, token
   - Use variables only where critical
   - Minimal secure default settings
   - Ready for terraform plan/apply without modifications
   - Clear resource separation with comments
Additionally:
   - Use one common network and subnet
   - Configure basic Security Groups
   - Add outputs for VMs' public IPs
The output must be strictly in main.tf file format, without explanations or additional text.
